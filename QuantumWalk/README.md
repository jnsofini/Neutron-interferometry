# Quantum walk
Simulation of a quantum walk with motivation from the diffraction of waves from a periodic lattice. 
Project on simulation of wave propagation using quantum walk techniques. The applications of random walks are enormous, ranging from the algorithm in tree traversal to simple illustration of Galton board.
In random walk, a walker or particle can jump to the left or right at the flip of a coin. After a certain number of steps,  the location of the walker can identified.
In the quantum version, the quantum coin is used and it typically is represented as a 2D SU(2) operator. The analogy is by stating that the coin is neither in the head or tail but a superposition.Â¶

Shown in the sketch is a cartoon of the propagation.
